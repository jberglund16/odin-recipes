    <p>The Perfect Ribeye Steak without a grill is made in a cast iron skillet and basted with herbs and butter. Yep, I said in a pan! Plus if you donâ€™t want to use herbs you can even just add salt and pepper.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 16-ounce ribeye steaks 1-1/2" thick</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 rosemary springs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees.</li>
        <li>Add the butter to a cast iron skillet on high heat</li>
        <li>Add the Kosher salt and black pepper to the steaks and add to the pan.</li>
        <li>Sear the steaks on high heat for 30 seconds on each side.</li>
        <li>Add the rosemary sprigs to the top of the steaks and spoon over the butter onto the steaks.</li>
        <li>Put the pan with the steaks into the oven for 4-5 minutes (if you'd like you can flip them halfway through - I don't and you can see how mine have cooked through.)</li>
        <li>Rest for 5 minutes before serving</li>
    </ol>
